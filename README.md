# networking_project
Final project for CSCI 420A Networking at Houghton College

Project was done under the guidance/help of Kevin Veloso (cousin).

The goal of this project was to utilize the knowledge of both networking concepts and python to create a network. Its medium is the air, and sounds represent 1s bits.
A laptop will make the sound via speaker, and the other will receive it via microphone and interpret the message.
For this project, 3 layers of the OSI Model were implemented: Physical Layer, Data Link Layer, and Network Layer. Not only that, but networking concepts such as encapsulation, when a host talks the other must listen, and transfer of work among layers were introduced.
